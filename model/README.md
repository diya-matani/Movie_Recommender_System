# 🎬 MovieFlix Recommender System

A premium content-based movie recommendation engine built with Python and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests 5 similar movies based on the selected movie's plot, genres, cast, and crew.
-   **Intelligent Fallback**:
    -   **Cloud Ready**: Auto-generates model files (`.pkl`) on the fly if they are missing (perfect for Streamlit Cloud).
    -   **Network Resilient**: Automatically switches to a sleek text-only list mode if movie posters cannot be downloaded (e.g., due to firewall restrictions).
-   **Netflix-Inspired UI**: Dark mode aesthetic with red accents and hover effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Streamlit
-   **Backend**: Python
-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
-   **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1. Local Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system/model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Deployment
This project is optimized for [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

1.  Push your code to GitHub (ensure `.gitignore` excludes large `.pkl` files).
2.  Connect your GitHub repo to Streamlit Cloud.
3.  **Configuration**:
    -   **Main file path**: `model/app.py`
    -   **Python version**: 3.10+
4.  **Deploy**: The app will automatically build the models during the first boot (approx 1-2 mins).

## 📂 Project Structure

-   `app.py`: Main application with UI and logic.
-   `notebook.ipynb`: Original research and model training code.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
-   `tmdb_5000_*.csv`: Raw datasets.

## 📝 Notes

-   **Large Files**: The generated `.pkl` files are ignored by git to avoid file size limits. They are auto-generated by `app.py` if missing.
-   **API Key**: The TMDB API key is currently embedded for demonstration. For production, use `st.secrets`.
